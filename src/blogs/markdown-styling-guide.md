Welcome to this comprehensive guide that demonstrates how different markdown elements are styled in this blog. Let's explore each element one by one.

## Headings

As you can see, headings use the Inter Tight font and have different sizes based on their level. The main title is the largest, followed by h2, h3, and so on.

### This is an H3 Heading

#### And this is an H4 Heading

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* to emphasize important points. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ when needed.

## Links

Links are styled in orange with a hover effect, just like in the footer. Here's an example: [Visit my website](https://adarshdubey.com)

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's styled with an orange left border and slightly muted text color. Blockquotes are great for highlighting important quotes or notes.

## Code

Inline code is styled in orange: `const greeting = "Hello, World!"`

And here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered List
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step
   2. Another sub-step
